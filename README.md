# Machine Learning for tortured sentences exctraction

In this repository, we propose a first machine learning approach to extract tortured sentences from suspicious scientific literature.

This repository is separated in two directories:
- The `dataset_analysis` provides the used Python code to build and explore a dataset from scratch.
- The `supervised_learning` provides the used Python code to train machine learning models for tortured sentences extraction.

## Dataset analysis

This directory contains four files:
- The `assessments.csv` which contains the suspicious literature metadata such as DOI and manually extracted tortured sentences.
- The `dataset.ipynb` IPython notebook exlaining the whole process to build and explore the dataset used for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `dataset_metadata.csv` which contains the metadata (DOI and tortured sentences) of the dataset used for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `dependencies.txt` listing the used Python version and associated libraries.

## Supervised learning

This directory contains eight files:
- The `cnn.zip` archive containing the CNN model with its best weights and its results for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `freeze.txt` listing the used Python version and associated libraries.
- The `lstm.zip` archive containing the LSTM (RNN) model with its best weights and its results for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `models.py` containing the models implementations.
- The `rcnn.zip` archive containing the RCNN model with its best weights and its results for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `run_train.sh` shell script to run the models training.
- The `supervised_learning.ipynb` IPython notebook explaining the whole process to build the labilsed dataset and display the obtained results.
- The `train_models.py` containing the code to train the implemented models.

## More information

The papers contents used in our dataset cannot be accessible through this repository since some of them are not freely accessible.

We thank Guillaume Cabanc, Cyril Labb√© and Alexander Magazinov for their precious work on the depollution of the scientific litterature through the [Problematic Paper Screener](https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener).
