# Machine Learning for tortured sentences exctraction

In this repository, we propose a first machine learning approach to extract tortured sentences from suspicious scientific literature.

This repository is separated in two directories:
- The `dataset_analysis` provides the used Python code to build and explore a dataset from scratch.
- The `supervised_learning` provides the used Python code to train machine learning models for tortured sentences extraction.

## Dataset analysis

This directory contains four files:
- The `assessments.csv` which contains the suspicious literature metadata such as DOI and manually extracted tortured sentences.
- The `dataset.ipynb` IPython notebook exlaining the whole process to build and explore the dataset used for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `dataset_metadata.csv` which contains the metadata (DOI and tortured sentences) of the dataset used for tortured sentences extraction.
- The `dependencies.txt` listing the used Python version and associated libraries.

## Supervised learning

## More information

The papers contents used in our dataset cannot be accessible through ths repository since some of them are not frrely accessible.

We thank Guillaume Cabanc, Cyril Labb√© and Alexander Magazinov for their precious work on the depollution of the scientific litterature through the [Problematic Paper Screener](https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener).
