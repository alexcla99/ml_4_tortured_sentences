# Machine Learning for tortured sentences exctraction

In this repository, we propose a first machine learning approach to extract tortured sentences from suspicious scientific literature.

This repository is separated in two directories:
- The `dataset_analysis` provides the used Python code to build and explore a dataset from scratch.
- The `supervised_learning` provides the used Python code to train machine learning models for tortured sentences extraction.
